## Project Description

Sentio is a user-friendly Android app designed to help friends and family stay connected through mood sharing. With detailed mood events that include photos, personal reflections, geolocation tags, and more, users can capture their emotional journey and share it with those who matter most. Whether you're having a great day or a tough one, you can log your mood with a photo, a short message, even your location—whatever helps tell your story. As your friends do the same, you’ll start to see each other’s ups and downs, creating a space where everyone feels seen, supported, and a little more connected.



## Key Features

- ALL USER STORIES covered
- Mood Event Posting – Log how you're feeling through mood events. Pick an emotion, add an optional reason or social context, and let the timestamp capture the moment.
- Mood History Feed - Scroll through your personal mood history in reverse chronological order to reflect on your emotional journey.
- Public & Private Sharing - You’re in control. Share your mood publicly so friends can support you—or keep it private just for yourself.
- User Profile Management - Build a unique profile with your own searchable username and display name.
- Following & Friend Requests - Send follow requests to friends, and accept or reject incoming ones.
- Social Interactions - Comment on mood events to show support. Dive into the conversation with comment threads and see whoever has responded to each mood event post.
- Advanced Filtering & Search - Looking for something specific? Use filters to find mood posts by emotion, keywords, or even by date.
- Geolocation Attachment - Optionally attach your current location when posting a mood. See your emotions plotted on a map and check out your friends’ emotional journeys too.
- Offline Functionality - Create, update, or delete mood events even while offline. Everything syncs automatically when you’re back online.
- Add Photos - Add an image to your mood post for a more vivid and meaningful experience (don’t worry, there’s a file size limit to keep things smooth).
- Color-Coded Mood Expressions - Emotional states are shown consistently with familiar emojis and colors — on your feed, maps, and more — for quick, clear mood recognition.
- Chat in Real Time - Message partcipants directly with real-time chat. Stay connected, talk through your day, and share how you're really feeling.
